 When I reached at Airport in Birmingham, I was so excited to see my college. My host advisor Faith Dobbs came to receive us and I was really happy talking to her because she is so polite and friendly in nature. Coming to the USA and studying at Gadsden State Community College is the most wonderful experience I have ever made in my life. From the very first day I felt it was an awesomely friendly environment. The staff, teachers and the students are so friendly that I never feel homesickness.  I make friends from all over the world and learn about their culture. I love the facilities provided by GSCC like Library, Social activities, Food of cafe, Campus life, Club Opportunities and etc.
It was great to get the opportunity to work with international club where I met with more than 23 different countries and felt amazing knowing their cultures. I went Oxford civic center where I served as a group leader and was leading 8th grade students. It was also a new experience and saw different career opportunities. I also went to Father’s heart food distribution for volunteer service where I was distributing and packing boxes and delivering food to poor people. It really makes me feel proud and was thinking at that time would that I could do anything for my country. I have joined Circle K club which helped me through various service projects.
Gadsden is a beautiful city. There is so much to do here, both socially and academically. Life at the Gadsden State community college is not only about academics, I have also been able to take part in numerous extra-curricular activities and societies which I would never have had the opportunity to pursue in back home. Finally, I would say Gadsden is a place where you can learn a lot, while having fun at the same time. I am proud to be an international scholar at GSCC and I thank the college and Irex for offering their support.

 What I have earned till now in USA is not money but experience, adventure, fun and love of Americans. I didn’t expect that my life would be so colorful, adventurous and fruitful in USA. Wow some the best spent entertainment money while in Florida. I think trip to Florida really worth it. I can still remember how excited I was before reaching in Florida. Just all the anticipation that was inside of me had just made the wait even longer for me. Finally, I heard the voice when he said 'welcome you all in Orlando, Florida'. When I heard those words I was so overjoyed I could hardly contain myself. It was half of the fun while traveling to Orlando.
I enjoyed in magic kingdom beautiful garden displays and powerful live entertainment in Cinderella’s castle. At the end of the day we were able to see some amazing fireworks at Cinderella’s castle. SeaWorld Orlando makes me fearless while riding on roller coaster. It was a tremendous roller coaster with more loops then I could count. We watched it go around once before we went on. Dolphin show was so surprising. I had feelings like these are humans and their every action was speaking some words and how friendly they were. I wished I would talk to them and understand what they are speaking. The South Beach of Miami fairly glitters with light and spent all day long and it was the fun place ever. It attracts me with the weather and blue sky with blue water. At last, we went to Indian restaurant ‘THALI’ woman who was serving was so good. After one month of staying in USA we had taste of Pakistani Food and we ate too much there.
I could go on for hours recounting the feelings, more than the places we visited. Thanks to my friends who were with me specially Komal and Umer for arranging digital camera and remaining credit to all who were organizing everything down to details like water, cold drinks, snacks and etc. I can never really think of a time in my life where I had a time that made me so happy.

My experience with UGRAD was nothing but positive and highly motivated. This program was an amazing experience not only stick to the academics but also traveling and exploring USA.I am totally changed and can differentiate myself before and after this program. I took the full advantage of this because i knew that it is the one and only chance to make the most of it and this opportunity can never come in your life again.
When I reflect on my experience as a Gadsden State Community College student and cultural ambassador, one of the first words that come to mind is personal. It was easy to quickly form friendships with the other design students who shared most of my classes. Not only were these relationships fun, but they were very useful as a networking tool to be more successful in my career. Being a part of Gadsden College, I felt each of my professors truly cared about helping me achieve my goals, both in my class and in starting my career. Community service projects, participation in International club and circle-K club helped me to enrich my leadership skills and to create positive impact in the society.
Now I am considering myself as groomed and confident not because of going to USA but what I have brought and will back to my country is “change” .For me “change is not to change others but to look back and help others to move forward”. UGRAD program was really a wonderful experience though it was short but this program gave me memories, some good friends, national and international, title of Cultural ambassador, and every single need that i wanted.
